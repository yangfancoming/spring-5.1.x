/**
 * Defines a factory which can return an Object instance (possibly shared or independent) when invoked.
 * This interface is typically used to encapsulate a generic factory which returns a new instance (prototype) of some target object on each invocation.
 * This interface is similar to {@link FactoryBean}, but implementations of the latter are normally meant to be defined as SPI instances in a
 * {@link BeanFactory}, while implementations of this class are normally meant to be fed as an API to other beans (through injection). As such, the
 * {@code getObject()} method has different exception handling behavior.
 * @since 1.0.2
 * @param <T> the object type
 * @see FactoryBean
