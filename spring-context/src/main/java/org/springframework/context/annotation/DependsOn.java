/**
 * Beans on which the current bean depends. Any beans specified are guaranteed to be
 * created by the container before this bean. Used infrequently in cases where a bean
 * does not explicitly depend on another through properties or constructor arguments,
 * but rather depends on the side effects of another bean's initialization.
 *
 * A depends-on declaration can specify both an initialization-time dependency and,
 * in the case of singleton beans only, a corresponding destruction-time dependency.
 * Dependent beans that define a depends-on relationship with a given bean are destroyed
 * first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed. Thus, a depends-on declaration
 * can also control shutdown order.
 *
 * May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with
 * {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Component} or on methods annotated
 * with {@link Bean}.
 *
 * Using {@link DependsOn} at the class level has no effect unless component-scanning
 * is being used. If a {@link DependsOn}-annotated class is declared via XML,
 * {@link DependsOn} annotation metadata is ignored, and
 * {@code <bean depends-on="..."/>} is respected instead.
 *

 * @since 3.0
